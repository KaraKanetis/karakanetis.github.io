The VIA-SEEs+ mission is a student-led CubeSat project designed to study how solar energetic particles (SEPs) impact Earth's atmosphere and space weather. The CubeSat, a 6U satellite, carries four different payloads—VIA, SEEs, CREPES, and AMPPS—each focused on measuring ozone depletion, charged particles, and plasma density during solar events. These measurements are crucial for predicting space weather hazards, protecting satellites, and improving atmospheric models. The data collected will help us understand how high-energy particles from the Sun interact with the mesosphere, contributing to future space missions and satellite resilience.

As an EPS (Electrical Power System) Engineer, my role is to ensure the CubeSat's power system efficiently distributes energy to all subsystems, including the payload instruments, onboard computers, and communication systems. I work on power budgeting, making sure each payload receives enough power while preventing system overloads. This involves optimizing solar panel efficiency, battery management, and power distribution circuits to keep the CubeSat operational throughout its mission. Additionally, I help design fail-safes and contingency plans to ensure continuous data collection even under unexpected conditions.

My work directly supports the mission by maximizing the CubeSat’s uptime and reliability. Without proper power management, the sensors and instruments wouldn’t function effectively, leading to gaps in data collection. Through my contributions, the VIA-SEEs+ CubeSat can continuously gather high-quality measurements of solar energetic particles, ozone fluctuations, and plasma interactions, furthering our understanding of how space weather influences Earth's upper atmosphere.
