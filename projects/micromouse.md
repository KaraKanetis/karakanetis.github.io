summary: "Ongoing research internship to study carbonaceous chondrites in micrometeorites."
---

As a student intern researcher, I study carbonaceous chondrite meteorites to understand how shock metamorphism, caused by high-energy impacts, affects their mineral composition. My focus is on analyzing carbonates in these meteorites to determine how impacts influence fluid movement and chemical changes in planetary materials.

I use Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMPA) to examine meteorite samples at a microscopic level. This helps me identify structural changes, mineral distribution, and deformation patterns caused by impacts. By studying these features, I work to understand the processes that shaped planetary bodies over time.

This research contributes to NASA’s efforts to understand planetary formation and impact histories. The data I collect helps classify meteorite changes and supports missions studying asteroids, like samples returned from Bennu. Through this work, I’m learning more about planetary materials and their role in the evolution of the Solar System. I'm still in the early stages of research, scanning and mapping the meteorites before I can continue studying how shock affects the individual chondrals.
