# Patterns in the Stars: Applying Software Design to Astrophysics  

---

## The Architecture of the Universe (and Software)

When you look up at the night sky, you might notice stars, constellations, and galaxies, but not necessarily the invisible forces and principles that hold them together. Gravity, dark matter, and magnetohydrodynamics aren’t immediately obvious, but they’re what give the cosmos its structure and behavior. Similarly, in software design, there’s often an invisible logic patterns that keep systems running smoothly behind the scenes.

Design patterns in software are kind of like the physical laws of the universe. They're not chunks of code you copy and paste, they're blueprints for solving recurring problems. They make complex systems easier to understand, expand, and maintain. As someone studying astrophysics and computer science, I’ve come to appreciate just how powerful these invisible frameworks can be, especially when trying to model systems complex as the cosmos.

## Discovering Patterns I Didn't Know I Was Using

Before I ever opened a textbook on software architecture, I was already stumbling into design patterns without realizing it. When writing simulation code for orbital dynamics or organizing large datasets from meteorite spectroscopy, I’d find myself reusing familiar structures: creating one instance of a telescope controller (hello, Singleton), separating data collection from data processing (Observer?), and building frameworks where components could easily plug in and out (Factory-ish?).

I wasn’t trying to follow any formal methodology, I just needed things to work, especially when juggling time sensitive data or working with teammates on messy legacy scripts. But looking back, I was unintentionally mirroring design principles that professionals have used for decades. And that’s super interesting!

## Making It Intentional, Designing Like the Cosmos

Now that I’ve started learning about design patterns more formally, it’s like I’ve been handed a cheat sheet for solving problems I already face. Whether it’s developing a modular planetary simulation in Python or writing more maintainable code for an observation scheduling system, I now think about things like loose coupling, abstraction layers, and reusable logic.

It reminds me of how astrophysics works at its best models built on tested frameworks, not just one off guesses. Kepler’s laws, the scalability of Newton’s equations, the design of a simulation that can swap in different gravitational models without rewriting everything from scratch. That’s what intentional software design feels like.

## Looking Up and Coding Forward

Understanding design patterns has honestly made me a better student and a better researcher. It’s made my code cleaner and easier to share. More importantly, it’s helped me think like a systems designer, not just a coder. Whether I’m mapping shock waves in chondrites or debugging telescope software, I now look for patterns.
