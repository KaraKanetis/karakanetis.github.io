<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
<p><strong>Project Title:</strong> StarMap UH</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Living in Hawaiʻi gives us some of the clearest skies for stargazing, but many students miss out on astronomical events simply because they don't know what to look for or when. While there are planetarium apps out there, they’re often complex, overly technical, or not tailored to the local sky. 
</p>
<p>
My project aims to solve this by creating <strong>StarMap UH</strong>—a simple, lightweight, and localized stargazing web app for UH Mānoa students and beginner skywatchers.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
There is a gap between general astronomy tools and accessible educational resources for students interested in casual stargazing. Many existing apps either overwhelm beginners or don’t focus on current, area specific guidance. UH students in particular don’t have a tool that’s made for them, with relevant celestial events and easy instructions to look up and connect with the night sky.
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>
StarMap UH is a personalized, browser based page for stargazing on Oʻahu. It includes a live sky map, a list of visible planets and constellations, and notifications for upcoming celestial events like meteor showers and eclipses. The app is designed with simplicity and education in mind, with beginner friendly guides and integration of UH Astronomy Club events.
</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Live Sky Map:</strong> Real time, interactive map of stars and planets from UH Mānoa’s coordinates</li>
  <li><strong>Tonight’s Sky:</strong> Summary of visible celestial objects for the current evening</li>
  <li><strong>Event Calendar:</strong> Localized astronomy events like meteor showers, ISS flyovers, eclipses, and club nights</li>
  <li><strong>Beginner Mode:</strong> Highlight 2–3 constellations per night with simple star-hopping instructions</li>
  <li><strong>Observation Log:</strong> Optional feature to track what you’ve seen and earn badges (e.g. "First Planet", "Shooting Star")</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mockup Page Ideas</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Landing Page</strong>: Dynamic night sky background with “Start Stargazing” button</li>
  <li><strong>Sky Map Page</strong>: Embedded interactive map (e.g. Stellarium Web or Three.js-based)</li>
  <li><strong>Tonight’s Sky</strong>: List of major visible objects, with fun facts and photos</li>
  <li><strong>Events Page</strong>: Monthly calendar showing celestial events and UH stargazing nights</li>
  <li><strong>Logbook</strong>: Personal observation journal, synced to date</li>
</ol>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Case 1:</strong> UH student walking home opens the app, sees Jupiter is visible, and learns how to find it by eye.</li>
  <li><strong>Case 2:</strong> New stargazer uses the beginner mode to learn 3 constellations, checking off “Orion” from their logbook.</li>
  <li><strong>Case 3:</strong> The Astronomy Club links the app to advertise its next star party and recommended viewing targets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beyond the Basics</h2>
<p>
Future development could include dark mode toggling based on time, user submitted images, and integration with mobile device sensors to use AR for pointing at the sky. The ultimate goal is to make astronomy more accessible, local, and fun especially for UH students who already live under one of the best skies on Earth.
