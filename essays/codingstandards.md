*What ESLint Taught Me About Coding, and Myself*

Before this course, I had a basic understanding of what coding standards were, but I didn’t fully understand their purpose. I saw them mostly as formatting rules and decisions about indentation, naming conventions, or where to place brackets. After working with ESLint in VSCode, I’ve come to realize that coding standards are much more than visual preferences. They guide how we write code in a way that improves readability, reduces errors, and makes collaboration easier, especially in long term or team projects.

My first experience with ESLint was frustrating. I wasn’t used to having my code flagged for things that didn’t seem like real errors. I ran into difficulties trying to preview code in Chrome, understand how the files connected, and troubleshoot basic configuration issues. I also found myself spending a lot of time trying to resolve what felt like minor issues, and it slowed me down at first. Looking back, part of that was because I didn’t fully understand the reasoning behind the rules, which made them feel arbitrary.

Over the week, I started to get the hang of it and the patterns. ESLint was helping me recognize redundancies in my code, improve the way I named variables and functions, and think more carefully about structure. I now I can began to work with more consistency and attention to detail. These improvements weren’t just useful for that week’s assignment, they’ve carried over into other parts of my work, including scientific tasks I do in astrophysics. When analyzing data or writing scripts for research, readability and clarity matter a lot, especially when working in teams or returning to older code months later. I plan on applying the same habits I learned from ESLint, even in Python environments where nothing is enforcing them.

## Learning with AI

I also occasionally used AI tools like ChatGPT to help clarify confusing ESLint messages or troubleshoot issues I couldn’t solve on my own. I tried to use them in a way that supported my learning rather than replacing it. For example, I would ask for explanations of specific warnings or ask how to restructure a function in a cleaner way. This helped me better understand not only how to fix the issues, but why the fix improved the code.

In terms of coding standards overall, I now see their value more clearly. They help the the code look nice, help with long term maintainability, catch potential errors early, and encourage developers to be more intentional in how they write. I’ve also noticedd it makes it easier to trace logic, reproduce results, and work with others effectively.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while my first week with ESLint was not easy, it was worthwhile. The process forced me to slow down and improve the quality of my code. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel more confident now knowing that these standards are not just rules to follow, but tools that support better development practices. As I continue coding—whether in coursework or in research—I plan to keep using what I’ve learned to write clearer, more maintainable code.
